Create a country music video featuring Adam Doleac as the performing artist, alternating between his live performance and a romantic love story. The video should rotate clips between two parallel narratives: Adam Doleac performing on stage, and a couple's love story unfolding.

For Adam Doleac's performance scenes: Show him playing the piano and singing the lyrics to the song on a stage in front of a live audience. Capture his emotional connection to the music, his performance energy, and the crowd's engagement. Adam Doleac should appear with consistent features - his recognizable appearance, playing piano with passion, singing with emotion, and connecting with the audience. The stage should have warm lighting, a grand piano, and an engaged crowd watching his performance. These performance clips should appear throughout the video, intercut with the story scenes to create a dynamic narrative rhythm.

For the love story narrative: Tell the story of a man and woman who meet and fall in love. The story begins with them meeting at a rustic country music bar, where they first connect over drinks and conversation at the bar counter. The man wears a classic brown leather cowboy hat and dark brown cowboy boots throughout all scenes. After their initial meeting, the next scene shows them dancing together to the song in their modern apartment, with a beautiful view overlooking a pool through large floor-to-ceiling windows, creating an intimate and romantic atmosphere as they dance together. The story progresses to a proposal scene at sunrise on the beach, where the man gets down on one knee and proposes to the woman as the sun rises over the ocean, creating a breathtaking and emotional moment with golden hour lighting. Finally, they have a beautiful wedding ceremony in a country-style venue, celebrating their love with family and friends, with the man still wearing his cowboy hat and boots.

Throughout all scenes, the same two characters appear with consistent features - the man always in his cowboy hat and boots, the woman with consistent hair color, face, and appearance. The characters maintain their youthful appearance and do not age, ensuring visual consistency across all relationship stages. The video should seamlessly alternate between Adam Doleac's passionate performance on stage and the couple's romantic journey, creating a cohesive narrative that connects the song's emotional themes with the visual story. Each scene should span multiple clips to fully develop the story and performance moments, with smooth transitions between the performance and narrative clips.
