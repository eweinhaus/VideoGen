Create a country music video featuring Adam Doleac as the performing artist, alternating between his live performance and a romantic love story. The video should rotate clips between two parallel narratives: Adam Doleac performing on stage, and a couple's love story unfolding.

Adam Doleac is a country artist in his mid-30s with dark brown hair and brown eyes. He wears a navy shirt with rolled sleeves. He performs on a concert stage with amber lighting, playing a grand piano and singing with mouth movements matching the lyrics, fingers synced to musical beats. Show him playing piano, singing expressively, looking at the audience, leaning to the microphone, having emotional moments, moving with the tempo, gesturing to emphasize lyrics, with the audience visible in the background. These performance clips should appear throughout the video, intercut with the story scenes.

For the love story narrative: Tell the story of Emily and Jake who meet and fall in love. Emily is in her mid-20s with long blonde hair and green eyes, wearing a red dress. Jake is in his late-20s with short brown hair and brown eyes, wearing a white shirt and navy pants. The story begins with them meeting at an upscale lounge with warm lighting, where Emily enters, they make eye contact, talk and laugh together, and have a deep conversation. After their initial meeting, the next scene shows them dancing together to the song in their modern apartment, with large windows showing a sunset view overlooking a pool. Show them inviting each other to dance, taking hands, swaying to music, dancing together closely, with wide shots of the couple. The story progresses to a proposal scene at sunrise on the beach with a colorful sky, where they walk together, stop to talk, Jake presents the ring, Emily shows joyful surprise and happy reaction, and they celebrate together. Finally, they have a beautiful wedding ceremony in a garden venue with flowers in the afternoon, showing the processional, them watching from the ceremony space, standing together, exchanging rings, the ceremonial moment, guests celebrating, and the recessional.

Throughout all scenes, the same characters appear with consistent features - Adam Doleac with his recognizable appearance, Emily with her long blonde hair and green eyes, Jake with his short brown hair and brown eyes. The characters maintain their youthful appearance and do not age, ensuring visual consistency. The video should seamlessly alternate between Adam Doleac's passionate performance on stage and the couple's romantic journey, creating a cohesive narrative with warm tones throughout.
