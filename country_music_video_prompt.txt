Create a country music video telling a complete love story between a man and woman. The story begins at a rustic country music bar with live music, wooden floors, and warm ambient lighting where they first meet, sharing drinks and conversation at the bar. The man wears a classic brown leather cowboy hat and dark brown cowboy boots throughout the entire video. After their initial meeting, they leave the bar together hand in hand, get into a vintage pickup truck or classic car, and drive to an elegant fine dining restaurant for their first date, with candlelit tables and romantic atmosphere. The narrative progresses through their relationship journey: they move into a cozy home together, showing domestic moments like cooking together, decorating, and shared life. Next, they get engaged in a romantic setting, perhaps at sunset or in a beautiful outdoor location, with the man proposing on one knee. Then they have a beautiful wedding ceremony in a country-style venue with family and friends, the man still wearing his cowboy hat and boots. Finally, they welcome a baby into their family, showing tender moments as new parents. Throughout all scenes, the same two characters appear with consistent features - the man always in his cowboy hat and boots, the woman with consistent hair, face, and clothing style. The characters maintain their youthful appearance and do not age, ensuring visual consistency across all relationship stages from meeting to parenthood. The video should capture the warmth and romance of country music storytelling, with authentic country aesthetics, warm golden lighting, and genuine emotional moments between the couple.
